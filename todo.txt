graph class:
- is_solvable() should recognize if it's visited a node before
- is_solvable() should keep track of the path it's taken to get to the current state
    - this is so it can avoid looping between states infinitely
    - should then be renamed to solve() instead of is_solvable()

unit testing:
- node class
- graph class
